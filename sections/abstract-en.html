<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This webpage presents an ontology for AFDD (Automated Fault Detection and Diagnostics) of buildingsâ€™ HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air conditioning) systems. The ontology incorporates knowledge extracted from machine learning-based FDD methods. Sensory data from BAS/BMS (Building Automation System / Building Management System) is intended to be enriched with contextual information extracted from BIM (Building Information Models) and be used for more effective FDD of HVAC systems. A taxonomy is created based on competency questions targeting at HVAC-related faults and by analyzing relevant studies and reported applications. Existing related ontologies in the domain of built environment were investigated, adopted, and extended to support the use cases related to fault detection and diagnostics of HVAC in buildings.</span>
