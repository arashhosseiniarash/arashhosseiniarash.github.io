<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
  This paper presents an ontology for AFDD (Automated Fault Detection and
  Diagnostics) of buildings’ HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air conditioning)
  systems. The ontology incorporates knowledge extracted from machine
  learning-based FDD methods. Sensory data from BAS/BMS (Building Automation
  System / Building Management System) is intended to be enriched with
  contextual information extracted from BIM (Building Information Models) and be
  used for more effective FDD of HVAC systems. A taxonomy is created based on
  competency questions targeting at HVAC-related faults and by analyzing
  relevant studies and reported applications. Existing related ontologies in the
  domain of built environment were investigated, adopted, and extended to
  support the use cases related to fault detection and diagnostics of HVAC in
  buildings. As a result, Brick ontology and Digital Buildings ontology which
  are used during the building’s operation and maintenance, were used to cover
  the building’s asset information needed for Operation & Maintenance. The HVAC
  FDD ontology is further extended by introducing classes required to
  accommodate knowledge and receive support from BIM and BAS/BMS to facilitate
  the AFDD process. The proposed ontology is extendable by means of adding
  further classes and/or relationships to allow answering/supporting other
  relevant competency questions/use cases. Facility managers, Asset managers,
  and building owners can benefit from adopting this ontology for HVAC
  maintenance.</span
